# vue-project-accelerator

Vue JS project accelerator that can serve as reference for bootstrapping projects. Includes localization and authorization via services based approach using vuetify for UX

The project aims to include many of the basic things one needs and includes:

- services based approach to encapsulate application logic and cross cutting concerns.
- use of [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for stores that augment the services approach
- models that encapsulate the view models used (see models folder and those types)
- localization and authorization via services.
- "toast" style notifications and "modals" for dialogs via vue3-notification.
- use of basic css instead of sass
- forms and validation via [vee-validate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/)
- use of HttpClient to call external REST API
- use of git hub pages to host the live example
